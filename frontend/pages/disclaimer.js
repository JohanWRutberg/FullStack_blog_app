                <h1>Affiliate Disclaimer</h1>
                <h2>How do we make money from our blog?</h2>
                Some links on our blog are "affiliate links," which contain a special tracking code. <br />
                This means if you click on an affiliate link and buy something, we get a commission at no extra cost to
                you. <br />
                <br />
                The price is the same whether you use an affiliate link or not.
                <h2>FTC disclosure compliance rules</h2>
                In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission set rules for Disclosure Compliance.
                <br />
                <br />
                These rules make sure readers know if a blogger or publisher is sponsored or partnered with a company.
                <br />
                <br />
                Readers need to know if the publisher makes money from sharing a link or product. Following FTC
                guidelines, please assume this about links and posts on this site: Some or all links on
                BeatMasterMind.com are affiliate links, which means we earn a small commission from sales.
                <h2>What are affiliate links?</h2>
                When you click an affiliate link on BeatMasterMind.com and buy something, you buy it directly from the
                seller (not from BeatMasterMind).
                <br />
                <br />
                BeatMasterMind may get a small commission from Amazon or other companies for sending customers to their
                websites. The price is the same for you whether you use an affiliate link or not.
                <br />
                <br />
                Clicking an affiliate link doesn’t change the price or anything else for you.{" "}
                <h3>Amazon affiliate links</h3>
                BeatMasterMind.com is part of the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising
                program designed to let sites earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and related sites.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you click a product affiliate link and buy the product, we get a percentage of the sale or some other
                type of compensation. Again, using these affiliate links doesn’t change the price for you. You won’t pay
                more by clicking through the link. These links are not "pay per click."{" "}
                <h2>Why trust our product recommendations?</h2>
                By telling you about our use of affiliate links, we want to show our commitment to being open and honest
                about the products we review.
